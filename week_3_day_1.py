# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users




# # 1.   Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2.   Mad Libs Game




































# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
age = 54
# 2. name
name = "Harold"
# 3. song
song = "Bad Guy"
# 4. food
food = "popcorn"
# 5. number
number = 560000

# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...
print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " year old coder named " + name + ". " + name + " liked to hum the song " + song + " while coding. It was so annoying that their teamates would throw " + food + " until " + name + " would stop singing. Still, " + name + " was the best coder on the team and could write " + str(number) + " lines of code every day. Maybe " + song + " was " + name +"'s secret power?")

# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].


# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.


# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?\
number1 = 100
number2 = 200
number3 = 300
number4 = 400
number5 = 500
#put them all into a sentence
# print("I have " + str(number1) + " cats, " + str(number2) + " classmates, " + str(number3) + " bags of rice, " + str(number4) + " bags of cat kibble, and " + str(number5) + " lines of code.")

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# 1st_name
# last_name
# email_address
# percent
# variable#ame
# 0
# listOfNumbers
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# lastName
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# first_variable
# email_address
# percentage
# illinois

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# #addition
print(2+1)
# #multiplication
print(2*2)
# #division
print(6/2)
# #modulo
print(17%4)
# #powers
print(2**3)
# #get the max and min of a number
print(max(1,5))
print(min(4,5))
# #round a number
print(round(3.72837))
# # absolute value
print(abs(-3))
# # order of operations
print(2*4+3)
# #to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
from math import *    
# #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
# #floor method
print(floor(3.7))
# #ceil method
print(ceil(3.7))
# #sqrt method
print(sqrt(36))

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print("Hello, " + name + "!")
# # # basic math calculator
# # #ask the user for 2 numbers
# num1 = int(input("Enter a number. "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter another number. "))
# print(num1 + num2)
# # # print out a statement where you:
# # # add them together
# # #multiply
# print(num1*num2)
# # # find the max number
# print(max(num1, num2))
# # # find the remainder of the numbers
# print(num1%num2)
# # #round one number
# print(round(num1))


print("This is your calculator")
inp1 = int(input("Please enter your first number. "))
inp2 = int(input("Please input your second number. "))
print(inp1+inp2)
print(inp1-inp2)
print(inp1*inp2)
print(inp1%inp2)
print(inp1/inp2)
